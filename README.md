# Palindrome-Checker
on the eight day of learning JavaScript via FreeCodeCamp

## Live Site
[See live on netlify] - https://palindrome-checker-1-0.netlify.app/?

## Features
nice mobile avability
check word if palidrome
deny wrong input if inputed
palindronis magic for palidrome answer

## Built With
HTML - since the course was mainly focus on javascript i just layout a basic button, div, and input element.
CSS - for this one i use animation since it was something i like when learning css and so i try to applied here with the hover aspect.
Javascript - since i just started using javascript i of course set it up so that there be more feature to understand more of the code such as the palidronis button which work only if you put a palidrome answer and sumbitted than hover over the word.(originally i want it to flip around the letter and let you see it is still the same but i coulnt figure out to or was too tire to make it)

## Attempt
time = aproximently 8 hour~.
ideas = I plan out the layout of how i wanted for this and had a theme which was magic/fantasy like game.

## Extra Comment By Me
for nearly all of these javascript project i did not use media query except for some of them and this is because i did not understand much of it even after the html and css courses, but only
after i found the importance did i use it and in all these javascript project i try to use most of what i learn of html and css and even those i dont understand from the courses so that i could understand them more.
